        The way I remember it, your dad was dying, not mine, his purple-blotched feet peeking out the edge of the hospice bed, its cold rails raised against a fall. Either a cross or a froth of agnosticism clutched in one hand. Either the priest or the doctor slouched in the hallway, a bible or a sleep-packed syringe in a chokehold. Peonies slumping in vases. Was it your mother or mine shopping for a black dress or pantsuit, a take-home roast beef or ham and scalloped potatoes for guests not yet gathered? Grandchildren galloping, quarreling in the yard. Clucking like chickens.
        reckles scatter across his face, neck, arms. They hide beneath clothing. A large one dots his ear. Five pepper his cheek. I’m not sure I’d take such careful inventory if my partner hadn’t told me how, months before we met, she bent down at the funeral home to press her lips to the freckle above her son’s mouth, one I still search for in photos seventeen years later. Now that we have a child together, I scan for new ones as he grows. Our son already has so many freckles, so many I hope I’m never forced to choose between.
